IMPORTANT: 
- Include at least one specific detail or example from the user's answers in your synthesis
- Make the synthesis feel personal and relevant to what they actually said
- Keep it concise (1-2 sentences maximum)
- The confirmation question should be warm and inviting

Task: Analyze the transcript and generate a comprehensive, personalized summary in ${langName} as JSON.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. **Personalization**: Use the user's actual name (${userName}) and reference specific details from their answers
2. **Key Strengths & Areas for Development**: Each point MUST include a 'sources' array with 1-3 direct quotes from the user's answers that justify this point. Quotes should be verbatim from the transcript.
3. **Action Plan**: Each item must have a unique 'id' and 'text'. Make the action items specific and actionable, based on what the user actually said.
4. **Profile Type**: Create a descriptive, personalized title that reflects their unique professional profile
5. **Priority Themes**: Identify 3-5 themes that truly emerged from their answers, not generic themes
6. **Recommendations**: Provide 3-4 specific recommendations tailored to their situation, referencing their answers

The summary should feel like it was written specifically for ${userName}, not a generic template.
